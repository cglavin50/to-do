# to-do list project
Creating my own personal to do list app. Followed tutorials on how to build out a backend in Go, as well as a different tutorial on creating a frontend web app for the actual list. I synthesized the two, added in a MongoDB, as well as created front-end functions to get all the user's tasks from previous sessions. Additionally, I created support to easily configure this with a local DB deployment, or a cloud DB, specified with a command-line arg.

## Future Work
1. Add more features to a task (ex due date, urgency, tag (like physical, work, etc))
2. Add login so other people can use the app, practice Auth0.
3. Potential to add mobile notifications if I use this app enough, send through my phone? This would require lots of mobile development, far down the road.

### References
As I wasn't familiar with building out an RESTful API and had no react experience, these two tutorials were useful when learning.
